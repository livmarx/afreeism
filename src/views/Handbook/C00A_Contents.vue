    Part I: Basics of Afreeism</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 1: The Illusion of Free Will</p>
    <p>Why free will makes no sense.</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 2: Autonomy and the Lens of Causation</p>
    <p>
      In the deterministic universe, the view of the future is radically different than the view of the past.
      Looking forward, afreeism counsels action. Looking backwards, acceptance.
    </p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 3: Desert and Moral Responsibility</p>
    <p>
      Free will is inextricably linked to notions of what we deserve and what we are morally responsible for.
      Without free will, the notion that we deserve something, good or bad, does not make sense.
    </p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 4: The Counterarguments and Why They Don’t Work</p>
    <p>Philosophers and theologians have been defending free will for thousands of years. Those defenses just do not work.</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 5: The Origins of Afreeism</p>
    <p>
      Afreeism is not a new idea. Indeed, the seeds of afreeist thought date back thousands of years
      and across a variety of philosophical and religious traditions.
    </p>

    <p class="contents-title">Part II: Afreeist Social Policy</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 6: Principles of Afreeist Social Policy</p>
    <p>Afreeist principles have something to say about social policy.</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 7: The Sinvergüenza Problem</p>
    <p>Can the world work without the internal checks of guilt, remorse, regret, and shame?</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 8: No-Fault Crime and Punishment</p>
    <p>
      Current thinking on criminal justice is largely based on free will. This is a mistake.
      But without a conception of free will, how can the criminal justice system function? It will function better.
    </p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 9: Wealth and Poverty</p>
    <p>Once we take off the blinders of free will, we can see that current structures of power, wealth, and income make no sense.</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 10: Afreeist Freedom</p>
    <p>Since the world is deterministic, can anyone be free? Here is a qualified yes.</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 11: Other Social Policy</p>
    <p>What does afreeism say about such areas as foreign policy, immigration law, anti-discrimination policies and the like.</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Part III: Personal Afreeism</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 12: Principles of Afreeist Living</p>
    <p>The afreeist perspective changes our view of the world and its inhabitants.</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 13: Humility</p>
    <p>The afreeist perspective is humbling. Good! The world could use a bit more humility.</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 14: Tolerance and Self-Acceptance</p>
    <p>
      Shedding the belief in free will affects the way we see others and ourselves, promoting both tolerance and self-acceptance.
      Afreeism has the potential to remove many obstacles to finding joy.
    </p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 15: Engagement and Resilience</p>
    <p>Afreeism tells us that what we do matters. It also helps us take a hit.</p>

    <p class="contents-title">Chapter 16: Meaning and Purpose</p>
    <p>Can there be meaning in a deterministic world?</p>
