          Determinism is the idea that events unfold due to causes and that humans are not
          exempt from these laws of the universe.  Some forms of determinism allow for randomness,
          particularly, quantum mechanical randomness.  
        <p>
          <b>Causal Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are caused.  Thus, the universe has 
          been and will be completely determined from at least the time of the big bang.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Stochastic Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are either caused or random.  That is, 
          there may exist some events, such as quantum events, that are truly random.  Thus, if we 
          reran the universe from any given point it could unfold in different ways.  Nevertheless, 
          there are only two types of events, those that are caused and those that are random.

        <p style="margin-left:20px;"> 
          <b>Strong Stochastic Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are either caused or random 
          and the conviction that there exist truly random events, such as hypothesized by 
          quantum mechanics.  This view is also known as indeterminism.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;">  
          <b>Weak Stochastic Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are either caused or random.  
          There may or may not be truly random events.  (The jury is out.)
        </p>

          We will use the general term <b>determinism</b> to describe both 
          causal determinism and stochastic determinism.  By this definition, if one says 
          that determinism is true, this means that either causal determinism or stochastic 
          determinism in one of its forms is true.

          Determinism relates to afreeism in the following way.  Determinism is the theory that all events
          are either caused or random.  Since the universe is deterministic, all events turn out the way
          they do as the result of a chain of causation.  This applies to human actions and decisions.  
          That is, humans are not exempt from laws of physics.
          Whatever action a person does, it is a result of a chain of causation and could not be otherwise.
          As a result, humans do not have free will.  This is true even if there is randomness.  Actions
          that are the result of, say random firing of neurons, cannot be the result free will.
