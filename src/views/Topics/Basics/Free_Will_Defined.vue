      <p>
              Here is the Merriam-Webster’s definition of free will:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:20px;">
        <span style="font-style:italic;">free will</span>, noun
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              1: voluntary choice or decision
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              Example: I do this of my own free will
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              2: freedom of humans to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention
            </p>
            <p>
              The first definition tells us nothing.  In common parlance, the word voluntary is simply 
              a synonym of of one’s free will.  To say that I do something voluntarily and to say 
              that I do something of my own free will is saying the same thing.  Thus, the 
              first definition does not help us. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              The second definition is more to the point.  It asserts that some actions are 
              determined by prior causes (or by a god) while others are choices that are not 
              determined by prior causes or by a divine being. Of course, even with this definition, 
              the freedom implied by free will is never unlimited.  I cannot choose to flap my arms 
              and fly.  Likewise, a driver who comes to an intersection may be able to go right or 
              left, but the path straight ahead may be blocked by a police officer or a barricade.  
              The definition implies, however, that when presented with alternatives, a person may 
              choose among them and that that choice among the alternatives is not determined by 
              prior causes or by divine intervention.  This is sometimes called the 
              <span style="font-style:italic;">freedom to do otherwise</span>.  
              Free will thus depends on the freedom to do otherwise.
            </p>
        <p>
          (Note: Some philosophers define free will quite unconventionally so as not to depend 
          on the freedom to do otherwise.  They claim that someone can have free will even if they
          were physically incapable of doing anything else.)
