    <div class="TopicHeading">Autonomy in a Robot World</div>

      <p>
      One way to examine how autonomy works in a deterministic universe is to 
      imagine how it would work in a world populated by robots.
      Of course, to a determinist, our world is a robot world.  Perhaps the only thing 
      that distinguishes humans from current robots is their complexity.  Robots can do 
      many of the same things that humans do.  Some things they can do better.  
      Others, not as well.  It is conceivable that one day we will develop robots 
      of such complexity that they will achieve consciousness and be able to express and feel emotion.  
      </p>
      <p>
      Even now we can create robots and imbue them with decision-making ability.  
      That is, we can create robots with algorithms for deciding.  We can 
      ask such a robot to make a decision.  Using its algorithm, the robot 
      will weigh many factors, will calculate outcomes, and will make a 
      decision based on the projected outcome that maximizes whatever goal 
      we specify.  In other words, the robot will be operating in much the 
      same way that we do.  Its decision-making process may not be as complex 
      as ours, but it is still making decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
      Looking at the robot through the lens of causation, we can see that 
      the robot, when it comes to a decision node, observes various possible 
      paths.  It weighs the costs and benefits of traveling one path versus another, and then it takes action, choosing one alternative over a number of others.  This is what we do too.
      </p>
      <p>
      However, when we look at what the robot did through that 
      same lens of causation, we see that, given the algorithm 
      that we imbued the robot with, given the alternatives that 
      the robot faced, and given the predicted outcomes of each of 
      those alternatives, the robot could have done only one thing.  
      We can look at the algorithm and the inputs and see that there was 
      only one path that the robot could have taken.  Looking backwards 
      in time, there was only one possible road.
