      <p>
        Freeism (freeâ€™-izm) is the belief in free will and all that that
        entails.  Afreeism (ay'-free-izm) is the absence of this belief.
        A freeist believes that free will exists and acts accordingly.  An afreeist 
        does not believe in free will and acts accordingly.  The two issues for
        an afreeist are (1) why should we not believe in free will, and (2) what 
        does an absence of free will imply about how we should act and feel.  This
        website addresses some of these issues.
