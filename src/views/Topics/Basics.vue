            <p><b>What is afreeism?</b></p>
            <p>
              Freeism (free’-izm) is the belief in free will and all that that
              entails.  Afreeism (ay'-free-izm) is the absence of this belief.
              A freeist believes that free will exists and acts accordingly.  An afreeist 
              does not believe in free will and acts accordingly.  The two issues for
              an afreeist are (1) why should we not believe in free will, and (2) what 
              does an absence of free will imply about how we should act and feel.  This
              website addresses some of these issues.

            <p ><b>Definition of Free Will</b></p>
            <p>
              Here is the Merriam-Webster’s definition of free will:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              <span style="font-style:italic;">free will</span>, noun
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              1: voluntary choice or decision
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              Example: I do this of my own free will
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
              2: freedom of humans to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention
            </p>
            <p>
              The first definition tells us nothing.  In common parlance, the word voluntary is simply 
              a synonym of of one’s free will.  To say that I do something voluntarily and to say 
              that I do something of my own free will is saying the same thing.  Thus, the 
              first definition does not help us. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              The second definition is more to the point.  It asserts that some actions are 
              determined by prior causes (or by a god) while others are choices that are not 
              determined by prior causes or by a divine being. Of course, even with this definition, 
              the freedom implied by free will is never unlimited.  I cannot choose to flap my arms 
              and fly.  Likewise, a driver who comes to an intersection may be able to go right or 
              left, but the path straight ahead may be blocked by a police officer or a barricade.  
              The definition implies, however, that when presented with alternatives, a person may 
              choose among them and that that choice among the alternatives is not determined by 
              prior causes or by divine intervention.  This is sometimes called the 
              <span style="font-style:italic;">freedom to do otherwise</span>.  
              Free will thus depends on the freedom to do otherwise.
            </p>
        <p>
          (Note: Some philosophers define free will quite unconventionally so as not to depend 
          on the freedom to do otherwise.  They claim that someone can have free will even if they
          were physically incapable of doing anything else.)

        <div id="Why_No_Free_Will" class="TopicExplanation">  
          <p><b>Why there is no free will</b></p>
        <p>
          Afreeists do not believe in free will because (1) there is no
          evidence indicating that it exists, and (2) there is a mountain of
          evidence indicating that it does not.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Free will depends on the ability to do otherwise.  
          Suppose that someone gets in a car, drives at an
          excessive speed and gets in an accident.  If the speeding
          were caused by an unknown brain tumor (discovered after
          the accident), then we conclude that the speeding was not
          done of the driver's free will.  Why?  The driver in that
          moment could not have done otherwise.  In general, if a 
          person cannot do otherwise, then there is no free will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evidence overwhelmingly shows that all events are caused or,
          in the subatomic quantum-mechanical realm, random.  Afreeists
          postulate that the laws of the universe apply to all events.
          That is, humans are not exempt.  All events, including actions taken
          by humans, are the result of a chain of causation.  This chain reaches
          back to before any of us were born.  Thus, whatever actions we take,
          we could not have done otherwise.  Thus do not have free will.  The notion 
          that we have free will is just an illusion.
        <p>
          This idea is explored in greater detail in the Afreeist Handbook, in the 
          Introduction and Chapter 1.

        <div id="What_Is_Determinism" class="TopicExplanation">
          <p><b>Determinism</b></p>
        <p>
          Determinism is the idea that events unfold due to causes and that humans are not
          exempt from these laws of the universe.  Some forms of determinism allow for randomness,
          particularly, quantum mechanical randomness.  
        <p>
          <b>Causal Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are caused.  Thus, the universe has 
          been and will be completely determined from at least the time of the big bang.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Stochastic Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are either caused or random.  That is, 
          there may exist some events, such as quantum events, that are truly random.  Thus, if we 
          reran the universe from any given point it could unfold in different ways.  Nevertheless, 
          there are only two types of events, those that are caused and those that are random.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;"> 
          <b>Strong Stochastic Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are either caused or random 
          and the conviction that there exist truly random events, such as hypothesized by 
          quantum mechanics.  This view is also known as indeterminism.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;">  
          <b>Weak Stochastic Determinism:</b>  The view that all events are either caused or random.  
          There may or may not be truly random events.  (The jury is out.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use the general term <b>determinism</b> to describe both 
          causal determinism and stochastic determinism.  By this definition, if one says 
          that determinism is true, this means that either causal determinism or stochastic 
          determinism in one of its forms is true.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Determinism relates to afreeism in the following way.  Determinism is the theory that all events
          are either caused or random.  There is no evidence that suggests that humans are exempt
          from the laws of causation.  Since the universe is deterministic, all events turn out the way
          they do as the result of a chain of causation.  This applies to human actions and decisions.
          Whatever action a person does, it is a result of a chain of causation and could not be otherwise.
          As a result, humans do not have free will.  This is true even if there is randomness.  Actions
          that are the result of, say random firing of neurons, cannot be the result free will.  They
          too are caused.
